# Code of Conduct DRAFT v0.1.0

[Form-Auto-Fill-In](https://github.com/iwasakishuto/Form-Auto-Fill-In) aims to automate day-to-day cumbersome routines and free up time for more interesting things.

**However**, there are some things that should not be fully automated. For example, in [UTokyo Health Management Report Form](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/covid-19/ja/safety/healthcheck.html), it is necessary to describe the body temperature. This is a tedious task, but by doing so, you can understand your physical condition and protect yourself and your loved ones from being infected with the coronavirus.

Automation is great, but it also makes sense to do the hassle.

Please aim for correct usage of automation.

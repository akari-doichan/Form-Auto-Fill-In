Contributing to Form-Auto-Fill-In
=================================

There are many ways to contribute to [Form-Auto-Fill-In](https://github.com/iwasakishuto/Form-Auto-Fill-In), with the most common ones being contribution of code or documentation to the project. I haven't made the documentation yet, so I would really appreciate it if you could. I'm planning to make a document under the `docs/` directory using [`pelican`](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/), [`Mkdocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/), [`sphinx`](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), etc.

But there are many other ways to help. In particular answering queries on the issue tracker, investigating bugs, matching `chrome-driver` and `chrome(browser)` versions in Github Actions (like [this commit](https://github.com/iwasakishuto/Form-Auto-Fill-In/commit/45904953087a92a6a2e1d6814b8cb75ef1f94e9b)), and reviewing other developers' pull requests are very valuable contributions that decrease the burden on the project maintainers.

Another way to contribute is to report issues you're facing, and give a "thumbs up üëç" on issues that others reported and that are relevant to you. It also helps us if you spread the word: reference the project from your blog and articles, link to it from your website, or simply star it in GitHub to say "I use it".
